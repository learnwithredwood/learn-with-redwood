question: Can I put the code on GitHub? Can I include within my portfolio? Can I blog about this?

Feel free to put **_your_** code on GitHub. But, please do not put **_our_** code on GitHub.

If you want to put this within your portfolio, please extend the core functionality that weâ€™ve taught within the course. If you bought the Starter package, consider upgrading to the Complete package, that includes a Figma file of ideas and designs for applying your new found knowledge and extending the application, beyond what we build together in the application.

Always be honest about the work **_you_** did and the contributions **_you_** made.
