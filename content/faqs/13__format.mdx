You'll receive a login to Podia. This is where we're hosting all of our course content.

Each lesson includes a video (including closed captioning) and its script or video transcription.

You'll also receive a Figma File with all the design elements, starter files, style guide, and stepped coded solution. We may throw in a couple of bonuses, here or there. ðŸ˜‰
