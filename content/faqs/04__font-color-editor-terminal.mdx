question: What font / color scheme / editor / terminal is that?
---
I use the font [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono). It costs ~$24 USD. But, I like it because it has ligatures specific for coding. If you’re looking for something free, [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is a great alternative, with a lot of the same features.

I’m using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Cobalt 2 Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2).

In general, I like to use the Terminal that’s built into VS Code. But, if I need to reach for something else, I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and the [Robby Russell theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme).
