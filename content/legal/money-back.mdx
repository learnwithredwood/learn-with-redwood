title: Refund Policy
slug: money-back
---

We want you to be satisfied with your purchase, but we also want you to give your best effort to apply all of the strategies in the course. The Company provides a 30-day money-back guarantee for the Program. That money-back guarantee is governed by the following terms:

If you decide your purchase was not the right decision, contact our support team and let us know you’d like a refund within 30 days of purchase [Refund Period]. Upon determining that you are entitled to a refund under this policy, the Company will promptly issue an instruction to its payment processor to issue the refund. The Company does not control its payment processor and will not be able to expedite any refunds.

After the Refund Period, all payments are non-refundable, and you are responsible for full payment of the fees for the program regardless of whether you complete the program. If you receive a refund of any purchase through this money-back guarantee, that shall immediately terminate any and all licenses granted you to use the material provided to you under this Agreement and the Company’s Terms of Use. You shall immediately cease using the material and shall destroy all copies of the information provided to you, including, without limitation: video recordings, audio recordings, forms, template documents, slide shows, membership areas, and other resources.

All refunds are discretionary as determined by ZEAL. To further clarify, we will not provide refunds for requests made after the Refund Period.

In all other cases, because of the extensive time, effort, preparation and care that goes into creating and providing the Program, the Company has a no refund policy. Unless otherwise provided by law, you acknowledge that we do not offer refunds for any portion of your payment for any of our Program and no refunds will be provided to you. By using and/or purchasing our Program, you understand and agree that, except for the limited refund policy described above, all sales are final and no refunds will be provided.

Since we have a clear and explicit Refund Policy in these terms that you have agreed to prior to completing the purchase of the Program, we do not tolerate or accept any type of chargeback threat or actual chargeback from your credit card company or payment processor. If a chargeback is placed on a purchase or we receive a chargeback threat during or after your purchase, we reserve the right to report the incident to all three credit reporting agencies or to any other entity for inclusion in any chargeback database or for listing as a delinquent account, which could have a negative impact on your credit report score. The information reported will include your name, email address, order date, order amount, and billing address. Chargeback abusers wishing to be removed from the database shall make the payment for the amount of the chargeback.

Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine how to discipline a participant who violates these Terms. Therefore, if a participant disagrees with how the Company disciplines another member and requests a refund, the Company will deny such request.

Furthermore, if a participant violates these Terms, the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to offer the participant another opportunity to abide by these Terms. If a participant disagrees with the Company offering another participant a second opportunity to follow these terms, no grounds for a participant to receive a refund would be created, and any request for a refund on this basis shall be denied.

If, in the Company’s sole right and discretion, you persist with behaviors or actions that violate these Terms, the Company may terminate your access and participation in the Program without notice and without refund.

If you have any questions or problems, please let us know by contacting our support team directly.
