Suprisingly enough, displaying a list of modules and lessons on the landing page was difficult.

![]()

## The Problem

- I wanted the numbers to continue from one section the next.
- I wanted to use CSS, as much as possible, making use of the `ol` element and it's built in counter

## Styling the Numbers

```css
.module-lessons {
  @apply list-none;
  counter-reset: lesson var(--start-value, 0);
}

.module-lessons li:before {
  @apply absolute left-0 text-tealGreen font-bold text-xl;
  content: counter(lesson);
  counter-increment: lesson;
}

.module-lessons li {
  @apply pl-[2.5rem] relative min-h-[50px];
}
```

```js
<ol
  className="module-lessons border-t-2 border-twine border-dashed"
  style={{ '--start-value': startingIndex }}
>
  ...
</ol>
```

I can pass `startingIndex` in as a prop.

...now, to determine what the `startingIndex` should actually be...

## Determining how many lessons are in a module

As I mentioned in a previous post, I'm using [ContentLayer]() to handle the mdx files for the site. So, the content the JSON that I'm getting from the server, looks like this:

![]()

First, I needed to format the data.

Not only did this make the content easier to loop over in the child component, but by converting the lesson string into an array, I was able to determine the length.

```js
const lessonsToArray = (
  lessonContent: string
): Array<{
  title: string
  timestamp: string
}> => {
  // split each list item into an array
  const splitContent = lessonContent.split('\n- ')

  // remove white space
  const list = splitContent.filter((el: string) => el !== '')

  // build an array of lesson objects
  const lessons = list.map((item: string) => {
    const [title, timestamp] = item.split('|')
    return { title, timestamp }
  })

  return lessons
}
```

My first thought was to store the lesson count, or what I'm calling the `startingIndex` in state.

But, I quickly hit an error saying I had too many re-renders.

![]()

The reason is that everytime the state would update, that would update each module block. That's not what I wanted! Instead, I needed a running tally.

```js
{
  data?.map((item, index: number) => {
    const lessons = lessonsToArray(item.body.raw)

    const startingIndex = lessonNumber
    lessonNumber += lessons.length

    return (
      <LessonModule
        key={index}
        title={item.title}
        order={item.order}
        lessons={lessons}
        startingIndex={startingIndex}
      />
    )
  })
}
```
